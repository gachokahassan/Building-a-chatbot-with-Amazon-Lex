# Building-a-chatbot-with-Amazon-Lex
The goal of this project is to create a banking chatbot that processes user interactions, handles fallback scenarios, and improves conversational efficiency.   In **Part 1**, I focused on:   - Setting up basic intents.   - Managing unrecognized inputs through a fallback mechanism.   - Testing and fine-tuning to ensure accurate responses.
